 * // - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization.
 * // - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in
 * // https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#configure_endpoints_for_the_client_library
 * try (FoldersClient foldersClient = FoldersClient.create()) {
 *   FolderName name = FolderName.of("[FOLDER]");
